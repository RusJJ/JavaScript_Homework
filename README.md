# Starting
To launch it you need [NodeJS (Download)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
This is a *simple* HTTP server, that contains my homework.

# Launching
After NodeJS install you must open command prompt using **Win+R -> cmd.exe**.

Use the following code to launch the server:
```
cd *path_to_server*
node index.js
```
